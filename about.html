  I'm 17, a junior in highschool and I enjoy using every part of the phrase "reduce reuse recycle" in my artwork. For reduce I avoid buying new art supplies if I already have a sufficient amount of materials. For reuse I use paint that I get from hardware stores that sell defective paint samples that would have been thrown away, old newspapers and cardboard boxes from family and friends, and I use an old coffee pot to clean my brushes in. For recycling I recycle any smal bits of cardboard that I can't use.
